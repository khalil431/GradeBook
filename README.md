# GradeBook

This is a WPF project (designed with the MVVM architectural pattern) that I developed using visual studio 2022. It is a CRUD desktop application designed with completely custom GUI and can be used to store information of students along with their marks. This project also implements the data exportation (to CSV) functionality. SQL, C#, and XAML were used in this project.
